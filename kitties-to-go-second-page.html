          pushing stuff off a table. Cat not kitten around claws in your leg

        <h3>Here's how you get started</h3>
        <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or
           knees and purrs you to sleep.
           Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns
           with a lap of carnation milk then
           <a class="intext" href="#13">retire to the warmest spot</a> on the couch
           to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between
           furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor;
           what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself
           intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
          <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch
             to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats
             are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when
             you are asleep stretch.</p>
